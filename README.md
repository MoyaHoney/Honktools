__Hi there!__

This is a simple repo for tools I've designed that I'd like to share across multiple systems. It's not really meant to
be collaborative just yet, and things might appear unfinished. As of the time of writing, I have no experience working
with open source projects or even posting stuff publicly, so you might be finding some awful or unfinished code in here.

I'm looking to publish this to a more accessible platform someday, so that I might be able to grab it via pip or
something. Right now, it's nowhere near that stage, so just tread lightly for now. I'm fairly easy to get ahold of.
Contact me on Steam or Discord if you have any questions.
